**Key Features**

*   **Wireless CCTV Integration:** Utilizes wireless CCTV cameras to capture traffic violations.
*   **Centralized Data Collection:**  Images and data from multiple CCTV cameras are transmitted wirelessly to a central server.
*   **Computer Vision Analysis:** Employs computer vision algorithms on the server to process CCTV footage and identify traffic violations.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides a web-based interface for real-time monitoring of traffic conditions and violations.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generates automated reports of traffic violations for law enforcement agencies.

**Benefits of ETLE with IoT**

*   **Accurate Data:**  Reduces human error in identifying and recording traffic violations.
*   **Automatic Operation:**  Minimizes the need for manual intervention, improving efficiency.
*   **Anti-Illegal Charges:**  Provides transparent and verifiable evidence of violations.
*   **Quick Action:**  Enables law enforcement agencies to respond promptly to violations.

**Technical Implementation**

1.  **Network Topology:** The system is designed using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a network environment with multiple CCTV cameras, access points, a central server, and client PCs.
2.  **IP Addressing:**  Static and DHCP IP addressing schemes are used to ensure proper communication between devices.
3.  **IoT Configuration:**  IoT devices (CCTV cameras) are configured to connect to the network and transmit data securely.
4.  **Web Interface:** A web interface is developed to provide access to real-time CCTV footage and violation reports.

**How to Use**

1.  **Set up the Network:** Configure the network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer according to the provided diagram.
2.  **Configure IoT Devices:** Assign IP addresses and configure the CCTV cameras to connect to the network.
3.  **Start the Server:** Launch the central server application to begin collecting and processing data.
4.  **Access the Web Interface:** Open the web interface on a client PC to monitor traffic and view violation reports.
